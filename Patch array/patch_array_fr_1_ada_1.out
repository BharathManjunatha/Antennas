 Storage using single precision

 Memory requirement for the in-core matrix:        64 rows *    67216 columns =     4301824 complex numbers
 For the MoM matrix, a memory of      8603648 complex numbers is used (i.e. 65.641 MByte)

     Per process, 81.838 MByte of memory has been allocated dynamically,
     which corresponds to 491.005 MByte in total for all processes together
     (peak memory usage of 95.145 MByte per process so far)
